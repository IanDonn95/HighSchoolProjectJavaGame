The game folder must be placed in the base of the C: drive for it to work properly.
This would be C:/Under Brain Revolution; it needs to be here to run at all.
In addition, to properly play the game, the resolution of your monitor should exceed 1000x850, the size of the game window.
There are 9 levels; the last two are a boss rush and all the levels put together (the way the game would be from the in-game perspective).
To play the game, run Under Brain Revolution.jar.
Doing so will bring up a launcher window in which you can adjust the settings, pick the level to play, and read the background story.
In the launcher, use the arrow keys to change the settings and select the level, and press enter to start the selected level.
You can play any level that has had all previous levels beaten.
The game will start out paused so that you don't get demolished in the first few seconds due to being not ready.
Pressing 'p' will pause the game, pressing 'p' again will unpause the game as long as you have the mouse near the ship.
To move the ship, simply move the mouse cursor around, and the ship will stay underneath the mouse cursor.
After you beat the level or die, the game will shut down.
If you wish to continue playing, simply run the .jar again.
You can adjust some graphical and performance settings if you are noticing lag in the launcher.
If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or need any help getting it to work, you can email me at IanDonn95@gmail.com or simply ask me in person.
Finally, if you manage to beat the final level (even on I Suck At This Game Difficulty), please tell me. I'd like to know if it is within human capabilities to beat it.
